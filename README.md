#Munch

You will need a usb-drive [at least 1gb] partitioned and set up with one of the following filesystems

 ext2/3/4 Btrfs fat32

Make sure boot flag is set

Run munch with device name [sdx] and iso file name [archbang-<date>.iso]

  sudo ./munch sdx archbang-<date>.iso

When you boot usb-device you will now be able to make changes to iso live and have them saved [persistence]
